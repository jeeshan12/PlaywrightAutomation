# Change <min> to be your # of CPUs divided by 2, and <max> to be # of CPUs times 2. This command will kick off your suite of playwright tests with different workers passed in (iterating through min/max). The output will be returned via the command line. And note, depending on your min/max inputs and how many tests you have, this process could take some time. So go kick it off and go brew some ‚òïÔ∏è or ü´ñ. Once the run is complete you should have an output that looks like this.
# for i in `seq <min> <max>`; do time npx playwright test --reporter=line --workers=$i; done
